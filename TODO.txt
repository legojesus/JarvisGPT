
- Add "VOICE" variable that determines whether to activate tts/stt or run in terminal mode only.
- speech to text always running and responding only when saying "Jarvis" - requires multi-threading. One thread listens while the other performs tasks so you can say "stop"/"mute" while it is speaking.
- reorganize main.py and cleanup. 
- reorganize all modules into folders. 
- add UI.
